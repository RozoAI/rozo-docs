# Welcome to ROZO

Our story starts summer in San Francisco, 2025, at a small boba shop that accepts USDC. I scanned the QR code with my mobile USDC app but it did not work.

It turned out the merchant only accept USDC on Base chain, while my wallets only support USDC on Stellar. USDC on Stellar is not the same as USDC on Base.&#x20;

Stablecoins are the best form of money on the Internet, but the user experience is still stuck in the early days. USDC exists on 29 different blockchains — and that’s not even counting USDT.

To pay for a coffee, why do we need to understand 29 chains, different stablecoins, different bridges, different fees? That’s _not_ how money should work.<br>

We’re building ROZO, the Visa for Stablecoins. We hide the complexity, and we are building the stablecoin abstrations.  You only need to think in _intents._
