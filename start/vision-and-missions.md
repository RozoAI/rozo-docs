# Vision and Missions

## Vision

Promote Economic Freedom



## Mission (SOFT)

**Simple. Open. Frictionless. Trustless**



**Simple:**&#x20;

One tap. As easy as a CEX — without introducing new risks.

Users should _never_ lose funds due to wrong chains, wrong tokens, or wrong memos.



**Frictionless**

It should be frictionless.  We believe crypto payments should be more frictionless than the traditional card system.  That's why we think crypto debit cards are meaningless. It's build on top of visa card network and make the money flow more complicated



**Open**

A building block that works across UI, API and smart contracts.

Composable. Permissionless. Developer-friendly.



**Trustless**

Users always control their funds.

No custody. No lock-in.
