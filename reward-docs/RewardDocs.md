## Points Usage

Display total ROZO points with a dropdown arrow. Click to expand and see detailed usage methods:

**Stage 0:** Earn 1 point per $1 spent. 1 point = $0.01 for shopping

Each stage increases ROZO point earning difficulty by 10x, while redemption value doubles.

### Points Earning Stages

| Stage | GDP M | Every $1 Spent Earns Points | Points Redemption Value (multiplier) |
|-------|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0.1 | 2 |
| 2 | 10 | 0.01 | 4 |
| 3 | 100 | 0.001 | 8 |
| 4 | 10000 | 0.0001 | 16 |

**Note:** As the platform's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) grows, the points earning rate decreases but the redemption value increases proportionally.
