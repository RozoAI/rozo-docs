## Q1: Do you think stablecoins are the final form of sovereignty?

**No, we don't.**

Stablecoins still have a fundamental problem: **they are still under government regulation.** They are just fiat currency in disguise. We don't consider stablecoins to be the ultimate form of individual sovereignty.

Here's a real example:

One of our team members had assets frozen in California simply because they hadn't been touched for three years. To this day, those assets still haven't been recovered, we're waiting on government approval. That's real money in a bank, real stocks, and there's no clear path to getting it back.

This is exactly why we believe:

> **True sovereignty means assets that cannot be arbitrarily frozen or controlled by any third party.**

Stablecoins are a transitional tool, useful and necessary for now, but not the end state.

## Q2: Very few people use Bitcoin for payments. Isn't the accounting too complex?

**Don't worry about this.**

The world flows freely toward value. Wherever there's real demand, people will solve the complex problems and make it work. Technical issues, compliance issues, they're all being solved.

For example:

**Jack Dorsey's Square** has already solved daily payment problems in the United States. The US is one of the most complex tax jurisdictions in the world, if they can solve it there, it can be solved anywhere.

So technology and compliance are not fundamental blockers in specific domains. They're just problems waiting to be solved.

## Q3: Isn't Bitcoin meant to be held? If I spend it now and it goes up 10x in ten years, won't I regret it? Why would anyone use Bitcoin for payments?

**This is a very mainstream view, and we respect it.**

That's exactly why we support a model where:

> **You pay with stablecoins, and the merchant receives Bitcoin.**

We believe this is the ultimate payment form:
- Users spend stablecoins (stable value, easy accounting)
- Merchants receive Bitcoin (appreciating asset, true sovereignty)

Everyone gets what they want.

Of course, some **crypto-native users** want to use Bitcoin directly for its utility as a P2P payment network. That's completely valid too, and we strongly encourage it.

In fact, many teams are already pushing Bitcoin payment adoption forward. Wallets like Bitpie, and Bitcoin's Lightning Network, are making Bitcoin payments more practical every day.

The Lightning Network also has an important feature: **privacy protection**. Unlike Ethereum, where on-chain behavior can be easily tracked despite using addresses, Lightning transactions are much more private.

Bitcoin is not just a store of value. It's a payment method you truly control yourself. No one can freeze your account. No one can censor your transactions.

## Q4: Can I store large amounts of money in this wallet?

**You can, but we recommend keeping large funds in more secure storage.**

Our wallet is designed for daily payment scenarios.

For large funds, we suggest:
- Self-custody with a hardware wallet
- Or store through whatever method you trust

Everyone has their own beliefs about what to trust, and that's okay. Trust your own tech skills? Use a hardware wallet. Trust institutions? Use institutions. Trust government regulation? Use compliant channels.

**Our positioning:**

We want this to be a convenient wallet on your phone for daily life. Small, frequent transactions.

We don't want you carrying around large amounts that might attract unwanted attention. That's not the experience we're building for.

> **Think of it like the cash in your physical wallet, enough for daily use.**
