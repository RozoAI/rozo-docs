# What's Missing
## Why Crypto Is Still Too Hard, Too Risky, and Too Far From Daily Life

## 1. The Core Problem: Sovereignty Exists, But It's Not Usable

We believe the world is entering an era of individual sovereignty.

But today, that sovereignty is only accessible to a few:
- Self-custody is too hard
- Operations are too complex
- The cost of mistakes is too high
- It can't be used in daily life

The result? Sovereignty becomes "looks free, but actually impossible to use."

## 2. What's Missing: The Problems That Shouldn't Exist

### Problem 1: Send to the wrong chain, lose everything

This happens every day:

> "Don't send to Base chain, or your funds will be lost forever."

A user sends USDC to the wrong network. The money is gone. No way to recover it. No customer support. No undo button.

**This should not exist.**

In any reasonable system, sending money to a slightly wrong address shouldn't mean permanent loss. But in crypto today, it does.

### Problem 2: One mistake, total loss

Forgot your seed phrase? Lost your hardware wallet? Clicked a phishing link?

**Your entire net worth, gone.**

There's no recovery. No second chance. No insurance.

This level of risk is not acceptable for mainstream adoption. People shouldn't need to be security experts just to hold their own money.

### Problem 3: Too many chains, too many tokens, too much confusion

- Which chain should I use?
- What's gas?
- Why do I need ETH to send USDC?
- What's a bridge? Why did it take 20 minutes?
- Why is my balance showing on one app but not another?

**Users shouldn't need to understand infrastructure to use money.**

### Problem 4: Can't be used in real life

Even if you successfully hold crypto:
- You can't pay rent with it
- You can't buy coffee with it
- You can't subscribe to Netflix with it
- You can't split a dinner bill with it

Crypto exists on-chain. Life exists off-chain. The two worlds don't connect.

**Sovereignty that can't be used in daily life is not real sovereignty.**

### Problem 5: Security means stress

"Write down these 24 words. Never lose them. Never show them to anyone. If you do, everything is gone."

This is the onboarding experience for self-custody.

**Security shouldn't require constant anxiety.**

Real security should be structural, built into the system, not dependent on users never making mistakes.

## 3. What Needs to Change

The correct approach is not to ask users to learn more.

It's to **hide complexity** while **preserving control**.

### Users should only think about:
- How much do I want to send?
- Who do I want to send it to?
- Do I confirm?

### The system should handle:
- Chain selection
- Gas fees
- Bridging
- Error prevention
- Recovery options

### Mistakes should be recoverable:
- Wrong address? Recoverable.
- Wrong chain? Auto-corrected.
- Suspicious transaction? Blocked and reviewed.

### Daily life should just work:
- Pay anywhere
- Any token
- No friction
- No learning curve

## 4. The Standard We're Aiming For

| Today's Reality | What Should Exist |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Send to wrong chain = funds lost | System prevents or auto-corrects |
| Lose seed phrase = total loss | Multiple recovery options |
| Need to understand gas, bridges, chains | User just sees "send money" |
| Can't use in daily life | Works like Apple Pay |
| Security requires expertise | Security is structural |

---

## 5. This Is Not a Technical Problem

All of these problems are solvable.

The technology exists. The solutions exist.

What's missing is **someone building it the right way**, putting user experience first, not blockchain ideology.

> **Sovereignty shouldn't require a PhD in cryptography.**
> **It should just work.**
