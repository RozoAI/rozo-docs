## 1. What is ROZO Intents?

ROZO Intents is an intent-based stablecoin SDK that enables users to transfer USDC and other stablecoins between chains like Stellar, Base, Polygon, and Solana with zero confusion and near-zero error. It is designed for real-world payment speed and reliability, combining stablecoin abstraction, automatic route selection for the fastest route, and optimized capital flow with transparent status tracking.

Rozo is supported by Stellar Community Fund, Base, Draper and Circle Alliance.
